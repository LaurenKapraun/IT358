			<h2>C. General</h2>
			<p>Overall, I found this article very interesting. I felt that a lot of the principles mentioned have also applied to website development projects I have worked on over the last few years. In our office, we were just discussing the traffic trends for our current sites, and have found that mobile and desktop stats are starting to have similar usage scores (<a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/desktop-mobile-tablet/worldwide/#monthly-201501-202001" target="_blank">gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share</a>). You can also see the drastic jump from desktop to mobile users around between 2015 and 2016, which is what made dedicated mobile application development very important. </p>

			<p>One of the biggest themes I found from this article, is the importance of usability and user experience (UX). Applications need to be concise because most users are utilizing applications to get quick information. Typically, if users are looking for in-depth information, they will use websites on a desktop or laptop. When using smaller screens, content can tend to look congested and overwhelming, causing users to leave the app and look for answers with the competition. </p>

			<p>The other major points they mention are the importance of speed, release cycles, and security. They mention, that the perceived performance has more of an impact on how a user experiences your app over the actual speed. By adding a loading animation or graphic, you are giving the appearance to the user that the application is loading faster than it may be. They also go on to mention that it is important to stay current with design and app functionality trends. Businesses are no longer able to do yearly updates, as they need to be continually evolving using an agile approach to stay competitive.</p> 

			<p>To wrap up the article, they state that most users are not aware of proper mobile security practices. Users want to be able to stay logged into apps, even though it is not secure. I do feel that Apple has helped with this issue by implementing the Keychain application that can use Face ID, Touch ID, or passcode to auto-fill usernames and passwords for websites and apps while maintaining a secure application.</p>
